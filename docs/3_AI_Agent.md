## Difference between Agentic AI and AI Agent

Agentic AI and AI agents are distinct but related. Agentic AI is a broader framework for building autonomous systems that can solve complex, multi-step problems, while AI agents are individual components within that framework, typically tasked with specific, narrower actions. Think of agentic AI as the "engine" and AI agents as the "parts" that work together to achieve a larger goal. 

#### Here's a more detailed breakdown:
#### AI Agents:
- **Purpose**:
AI agents are designed to perform specific tasks within a defined scope, often with limited autonomy. 
- **Autonomy**:
They typically follow predefined rules and scripts, making them less capable of adapting to unexpected situations. 

**Example**:
An AI agent could be a virtual assistant that handles customer service inquiries, or a program that manages inventory. 


#### Agentic AI:
- **Purpose**:
Agentic AI is a more advanced approach that allows systems to operate with greater autonomy, making decisions and taking actions without constant human oversight. 
- **Autonomy**:
Agentic AI systems can perceive their environment, reason through problems, and act on their plans, adapting to changing conditions. 

**Example**:
An agentic AI system could manage a smart home, coordinating various AI agents (like thermostats, lighting, and appliances) to optimize energy consumption based on real-time data and user preferences.
